HOME 1.1

You did it.
You think you did it.
You'll need to test it to be certain.

If you're correct, all you'll need to do to open the altered safe is to turn the dial 90 degrees to the left, like this.
The altered safe opens smoothly - just as you spelled it.
It did hurt more than you expected, but it looks like the exercises Page taught you finally paid off!

You examine the effects of your first real spell on the inside of the safe.
You note that it's empty - this is not unexpected - you didn't spell anything inside, after all.

You hear footsteps.

Nobody should be in here other than you. You have three locked doors to keep it that way.

No use running - your room is a dead end. 
Retreating into your shell, the approaching footsteps grow louder.

From within your shell, you watch the intruder enter your room through the keyhole doorway.

You clench your eyes shut. You don’t care if it makes you a bad apprentice - you don't want to watch.

You hear the soft footsteps of the intruder circle you.
You imagine the sensation of being ripped from your shell and eaten alive.
You brace for death - or something.
You’ve never seen a person eat an animal, now that you think about it. Maybe it’s looking for something shiny? 

You peek out from your shell.
The intruder is gone.
You are confused. What did it want? Just to stroll in through three locked doors and stare at you?

Whatever.
You don’t care what it wanted, or if it wanted anything. You’re alive and there are spells to spell.

You turn to the space your Grimoire once occupied.
You are certain this is where you left it. 
You are like 95% certain.

You think you found out what the intruder wanted.

You pursue.

You emerge into the main room, just catching the sight of the thief retreating through the innermost door of your house. 

Every door is open.
No visual indications of brute force.
The locks are still somehow set… 

Standing outside your front door, you spot the thief down the street.

You continue your pursuit.
Something is off about the thief - it looks like a person but it’s walking. The people stumble, limp, or crawl - they don’t walk.
Something Page once told you echoes in your head. What did they call them again…? 

The thief turns into the park, slipping into a pack of people.

Pushing through the forest of people legs, you just barely glimpse the thief’s hat disappearing behind a tree.
You round a corner to find the thief doing something with the paper tree.
Did it know you were chasing it?
Was it luring you?

You hide behind a rock.
You didn’t think of how exactly you would get your grimoire back. You don’t think you could take the thief in a fight. It’s way too big and you’re more of the hide in your shell or behind a rock type.  

Meat 
yooo 
You stifle a shocked scream.

This bear is named Meat, and he’s kind of a friend of a friend. You don’t really know him. He’s always trying to hang out with you. 
Meat 
youre tracking this thing too? 
i caught a sniff of it down the hill 
Home
...
Meat 
cool cool
hold on - im going in for the kill

Meat easily picks up the thief by a leg.
It screams. The contents of the thief’s bag fly everywhere.

Before you know what you're doing you step out from behind the rock.
Home
H-hey - Meat…?

Meat 
you say something?
i was just about to eat this thing
Home
I - I think you shouldn’t do that.
Meat 
i 
shouldnt eat this thing? 
Home
No?
Meat 
are you ok?
you smell scared 
Home
It’s - it’s a Moon-thing - not good for eating.
Page told me.

Meat 
smells bad anyway
Meat unceremoniously drops the moon-thing on the ground. It immediately begins a frantic search in the fallen paper tree leaves for something that spilled from its bag.

You share a strangely meaningful look with the moon-thing as it picks up your grimoire from a pile of paper leaves and gets up to sprint away.
Meat 
yeah you better run!
dont let me smell you again moon thing!

You’re defeated.
You could continue to chase the moon-thing, but you wouldn’t be able to catch them - plus it's got a head start now.
You unconsciously mumble to yourself an affirmation of the reality of whatever the hell just happened.  
Home
It stole my grimoire…

As you make your way over to the ledge to get a better view of the line of trees the moon-thing disappeared into, you stumble over something bound and wooden hidden under the fallen pages of the paper tree.
Meat 
girlfriend?

It’s a grimoire.
Its cover bears a striking resemblance to yours, the intricate designs almost identical.
Meat 
yo
a girlfriend? i didnt catch what you said
Home
A grimoire.
…I-It’s like a book you write in - not like the books Page has.
Meat 
didnt you get it back?
isnt that yours?
Home
Um.

You take the abandoned grimoire, its wood cover feeling too familiar for you to have never touched it before.
Home
Y-yeah it’s mine.
Problem solved.
Meat 
awesome!
speaking of the spider i was gonna head over to their house after i did my hunting 
you want to come with?    
Home
Um - I - probably not, i think i need to deal with this grimoire thing.
Meat 
sure sure

Your hands tingle from the grimoire’s magic radiation. It’s much more powerful than yours, it’s almost starting to hurt.
Meat 
you live around here?
Home
Yeah. U-up the hill there, behind the clouds.
Meat 
no way!
we live so close! im located kinda all over the woods down there and in the city sometimes
we could hang out so easily! 
Home
No - I mean yes - I mean l-later - yes, not now but later.
I need to go.
You leave Meat at the paper tree and make your way up the path back to your house absorbed in the pages of the replacement grimoire.
Meat 
catch ya later bud! 

MISHA 1.1

You lovingly place the final hot bloodcake atop your hot bloocake pyramid.

You retrieve the plate of cold cuts you strategically placed in the walk-in to cool while you were frying the bloodcakes.

You grab the plate of hot bloodcakes.

You wonder who you’ll share your snacks with today. You’d normally go with S, but he’s been in a weird mood. Maybe K? You don’t think she likes hot bloodcakes or cold cuts though.

You think you’ll just go down to the ground level - maybe sniff out a friend. 

You run into a problem with the door to the stairway.
You can’t turn the handle since your hands are full with your snacks.
You smell something witchy approaching from behind.

It’s Pagan!
With a big box!
You are amused by how large the box is in comparison to how small Pagan is.
Misha 
yooo
lol
Pagan
Hello Misha.
Misha 
need help?
Pagan
No thank you.*
*How are you going to help me if your hands are full, anyway?

Pagan
Are you going down?
Misha 
yeah actually but i couldnt open the door because my hands are-
Pagan presses the down button for the elevator.
You didn’t think of that.
Misha 
right

A witchy silence fills the hall as you and Pagan wait for the elevator. It's so hard to know what witches are feeling. Their smell feels segmented to you like all their feelings don't touch each other.
You eat a cold cut.
Misha 
(chewing)

The elevator arrives.
Misha 
whats up with the box?
Pagan
Tools.
I need to take a door off its hinges.
Misha 
you need tools for that?
(chewing)
i could take one down easy
Pagan
I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking for a lower-impact solution.
Honestly, you don’t know if Pagan even eats, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.
Misha 
hot bloodcake?
(swallowing)
Pagan
No, thank you.

Maybe they’re more into cold cuts?
Misha 
cold cut?
Pagan
No, thank you.
This might be harder than you thought.

You follow Pagan off of the elevator.

Pagan starts doing some witch stuff on the door.
This must be the door they care about so much.
You could take it.
Also it smells weird.
Misha 
so this is it?
Pagan
This door is never locked and there's a draft coming from underneath - I want to know why.
Misha 
i could take it

Misha 
(chewing)
you really dont want one? its so good
Pagan
No, thank you. I ate before.
Can you lift the door out of the frame?
Misha 
sure one sec

You shove the last of your snacks into your mouth.
Pagan
So when you lift it, you’ll want to pull away from the latch-
Misha 
(chewing)
yeah yeah i gotcha

You lift the door out of its frame.
The weird smell gets stronger.
Misha 
(chewing)
where do you want it
Pagan
Um - over there against the wall.

You place the door against the wall.
Pagan
Interesting…
Misha 
thanks
Pagan
No, there’s another door.

There’s another door.
Misha 
huh
Pagan
It looks like a bathroom push door.

You try the new door.
It doesn’t budge.
Misha 
this ones locked too
man do you not smell that?
Pagan
…
No.
What do you smell?
Misha 
cant really describe it - its kind of old brownish-gray
Pagan
Hm.

Pagan gets a weird look on their face. You think they are probably thinking about witch stuff. You figure they’re trying to figure out how to magic open the door. 
Also you’re thinking about how good those bloodcakes were and how you should make another batch after this.

Pagan
Misha, I can’t take this door off its hinges.
Could you break it down?
When did Pagan get so cool?
Nobody ever asks you to do this type of stuff anymore!
Misha 
I would love to.

Pagan
Remember to focus your kick around the lock, avoid kicking it directly- 
Misha
kicking?
i know what im doing i used to do this stuff all the time
its all about the shoulder
You get a running start and ram the door as hard as you possibly can with your good shoulder.

You immediately regret getting a running start and ramming the door as hard as you possibly can with your good shoulder. You feel your hastily swallowed snacks almost come back up.
Misha
shit
Pagan
Maybe we should-

Fueled by the beating pain in your now bad shoulder, you go crazy - just all-out on the stupid door until there's nothing left.

Pagan
I… I think that’s good.
Misha
what did you say?
(panting)
sorry…
i was just - just going crazy…
(panting)
just all-out!
(panting)
stupid door!
(panting)
damn!

You and Pagan peer into the brightly lit room beyond the broken down door.
Misha
Ohhh
so thats why it smelled so weird
MEAT 1.1

You collapse.
Why do there have to be so many stairs?
It feels like whenever you hang out with Page you have to drag something all the way up to the roof of their house.

They have to be up here.
You’re pretty sure you can smell them up there. It’s hard to tell where your friend is when they’re in their house.

You grab your snack, grit your teeth, and growl through the final flight of stairs.
You couldn’t find Page anywhere downstairs last night - partly because it was too dark to see anything and partly because you fell asleep pretty quick after you got there.
Meat
grrr

You exit the stairwell and onto the roof of Page’s house.

You take a moment to taste the air.
You smell a few hues, a lot of paper, and something colorless, odorless, and tasteless.
Now you know Page’s up here for sure.

You heave your snack onto your shoulders, and follow your nose.
The non-smell gets stronger.
You never got this smell’s appeal. There’s nothing really there for you to sink your teeth into - plus it reminds you of people, and people are gross.
You don’t know how Page can take it. Actually, you don’t know if they have a nose, so maybe they can’t smell it at all? 

You step into Page’s office.
Meat
yooo
Page
Hello Meat.

Meat 
whats up?
Page
There’s been a disturbance on the web.
Meat 
ok
awesome
(chewing)

Page circles a picture on the computer screen in a cold lavender.
Page
Three hours ago the Eighth Lunarian posted this image. It was quickly picked up by the people and has been trending on a few social networks.
Meat 
(swallowing)
lol
kind of looks like you and me
Page
I’ve read anthropological papers on similar iconography.
Lunarian culture would consider this image an offensive or satirical stereotype.    
Meat 
huh
ok
(chewing)

Page catalogs distinctive features of the image.
Page
Satirical or not, the important question is what the Eighth Lunarian is seeking to accomplish with the post…
The only other time they posted an image like this was years ago, and I only have dead net documentation of that time…

You add bloody claws, teeth and hearts on the image in a hot red, your paw wrestling the mouse.
Page
Meat, please.

Page closes the image.
Meat 
were you up here all night?
(swallowing)
Page
What do you mean all night?
I’ve been here all day, it’s 5:00 PM.
Meat 
(chewing)
five?
like in the night?
(swallowing)
Page
5:00 PM is considered to be early evening.
Wow you were really knocked out!
Page
Successful hunt I see?
Meat 
oh yeah it was ok
actually i was about to eat this crazy smelling person thing up by the paper tree when Home pops outta nowhere and tells me not to eat it cause its not good to eat or something!
told me that you told them about it
anyway so i dropped it and found THIS one-
Page
Something not good to eat?

Meat
they called it a moon… guy…?
Page
The weird smell - did it happen to smell like something old?  
Meat
mmmm 
(chewing)
yeah
kinda dusty and stale id say 
that wasnt the weirdest thing tho
the thing took Homes
uh
 grim- grim-something… 
Page
It took Home’s grimoire?
Meat
yeah!
(swallowing)
grimoire!
like why steal one of THOSE?
anyway its ok now since Home found another one
Page goes quiet.
Page
…
Meat
(chewing)
Page turns off the generator.
You remember the day you and… somebody… dragged it up here, laughing and struggling.
Page
Would you mind taking me over to the north window?

You offer your paw to Page.
Meat
yeah
Page
Thank you, Meat.
Meat
no problem
which way is northern
Page
I’ll direct you.

Guided by Page's instructions, you navigate through the cluttered office, sidestepping stacks of papers and books meticulously organized into a chaos only Page understands. The non-smell of the room fades as you approach the window, replaced by the fresh, crisp green air of the outside world.

You encounter a problem.
Meat
i dont think i can get thru dude…
is there another way?
Page
It’s ok - just stick your paw through, I’ll be able to see it from there. 

Page crawls down your arm and through the gap in the bookcases.
Meat
what is it
Page
Interesting…

You try to squeeze through… There’s a little give.
Meat
dude come on what is it?
lol

You again try to squeeze through, seriously this time.
Page
Meat, wait- I’m not sure you’d even be able to see-

You topple the bookcases.
Books and picked paper leaves fly everywhere.
The crash reverberates through Page’s house.
Meat
oh shit Page are you ok?
Page crawls out of the debris.
Page
I’m fine.
Meat
sorry lol i didnt mean to knock them over…
Page
*Sigh*
It’s fine, you can take a look.

Page
Do you see it too?
You look out the window.
The view is of the road winding through the coastal city and up into the cloudy mountain range by H’s house. The crisp greens and browns of your forest fight with the dark blues and salty whites of the ocean, everything bathed by a dusky twilight sky.
​​Between the ground and sky, you smell creatures of various forms and sizes going about their evening, blood misted wolves sharing a meal, a pair of crows searing smoky burgundy over the water, people returning to their nests in clouds of colorless co2…
Meat
where should i look?
Page
It’s ok if you don’t see it, it’s subtle.
Look at the basketball court by Home’s house.
Meat
what is a basketball court?
like law?
Page
Basketball is a people sport in which two teams, typically consisting of five players each, oppose each other on a rectangular court with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop, a basket mounted 10 feet high to a backboard at each end, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. The game is played over four quarters of varying lengths, usually 10 or 12 minutes each, depending on the league. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. 
Meat
…
youre gonna hate me lol
could you repeat that
i kind of zoned out im sorry
Page
Find the blookcake billboard, then look below it and to the left - that’s the basketball court.
Meat
oh nice i know that one
imagine if i was like “whats a bloocake” lol
…
wait where’s left?
Page
Your bad shoulder.
You squint.
You guess you can’t see it…

You let out a disappointed sigh.
It’s witch stuff, you get it. 
Page
Do you have any plans today?
Meat
(swallowing)
just this
more hunting later if i dont have leftovers


PAGAN 1.1

There was an ID here.
Judging by the dust, you figure someone must have recently removed it.

The ID’s owner died a good apprentice, you think. 
From the look of the room you figure they barricaded themselves in here and went through a meager hoard of food, documenting every moment of it on almost everything they could write on until the end.

Misha
yo this ones clear too
You forget that Misha’s a fully-trained military dog. Giving him commands reminds you of your days as a black hat with your assigned beast… What was his name…?

PAGE 1.1

Meat
yo check it
Meat shoots and misses.

The ball bounces off of the head of a person and disappears into a pool of abyssal discharge.

Page
Meat, please!
Meat
my bad

The scene proves Home somehow got their hands on the first lunarian’s grimoire.
They must have been overwhelmed by its magical radiation, causing a purge of what looks to be near pure antipodal matter.
The volume of the discharge could indicate that the switched grimoire is not as powerful as you thought - even a generous calculation of Home’s mass would yield 4 or 5 times the volume. 
This could indicate one of the following:
1. The first lunarian’s grimoire is underpowered.
2. The grimoire was somehow tailored for Home.

Meat
yo Page
Page
…
Meat
yo do you think Home went in here?
Page
what?
Meat points out a melted hole in the fence across the court.
Meat
do you want a ride?

PAGAN 1.2

You study the skyline.
The fallen world tree, Tryggdrasil, dominates the almost unrecognizable school subdistrict to your left.
In front of you sprawls the remaining twin of the Fourth District’s twin capital cities. Always struck you as ironic that the neglected underfunded twin was spared in the felling. 
In the distance, to your right, you can almost make out the sapling. you try to judge the growth visually with little success. You've been tracking its progress meticulously, using the annual vote as an opportunity to measure its development. Lately it’s been going through what you theorize is a kind of growth spurt.
You wonder if it all will ever become familiar to you again.

You close your eyes.
Your thoughts are tangled.
One thread at a time.

You start with the immediate problem.
Pagan
Misha, please, stop
It’s pointless.
I’ll have to look closer to find another way in.
Misha
…
Pagan
What are you doing?
Misha
i dont know 
im mad
Pagan
About what?

Misha
bro
you knew H was in danger and you didnt accept  help.
what the fuck???
i thought this was just a fucking quick Pagan witch adventure! 
Pagan
I never told you that it would be an adventure.
Misha
you never told me anything!
what if H gets hurt?
or maybe they are hurt already and you knew and didnt tell me! i dont know anymore!
Pagan
There is a very low percent chance of H being in danger.
I thought I made it known that this was a witching operation, i.e. low impact, i.e. groups of three or less.
I’m sorry. I’ll have to be more direct in the future. 

Pagan
Can you help me set up the relays for the field  spectrometer?
I think I just need a closer look at the door.
The signatures could have moved, possibly causing-
Misha
we dont need the field spectro thing
H is in there
i smell them
Pagan
…

Pagan
If you are not going to help, leave, Misha.
This is witching business.

You catch a microscopic glint of light as Misha looks away from you.
He’s clenching and unclenching his fists.
Misha
H is
is in…
there…
(sniffing)
alone…
Pagan
…

You pick up your field spectrometer case and walk away, struggling under its weight.
You really don’t have time for this.

You find a good centered spot across the street from the locksmith building and attempt to carefully place the field spectrometer case down on the sidewalk.
 
You take out a tangled  relay cord web for the field thaumaturgic radiation spectrometer.

You begin to untangle the ball of cords.
You find yourself getting unexpectedly frustrated with the activity.

A pair of rubber slip-ons interrupt your untangling.

You look up.
M looks smaller than usual.

You and M manage to lay out the relay cord web.
Now all you’ll have to do is to attach the relays.
