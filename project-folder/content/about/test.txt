Beast	of	 Order

Beast of Order

Highly critical both of self and others: picky, judgmental, perfectionistic. Very opinionated about everything: correcting people and badgering them to “do the right thing”—as they see it. Impatient, never satisfied with anything unless it is done according to their prescriptions. Moralizing, scolding, abrasive, and indignantly angry.

You are in the realm of chaos and disorder.
(you are an Ice giant from the tribe lands, moved to the big city, low quality of life, cold and mountainous, cold bureaucratic chaos)



Your once temporary, now painfully permanent workspace is in a state of disarray.
You won’t be able to get anything done before you organize.

(one mug on table) 


You check your calendar while you rinse your mug.
You forgot it was today…
Maybe you’ll call ANGIE to see what the group’s doing tonight. 

You stare at your laptop’s login screen.
You made the background a screenshot of the completed infuser design. It’s become an increasingly unpleasant reminder of how long the audit has lasted.



For nearly a year they’ve kept you from actually engineering  with pointless reviews, signatures, meetings, tests, and emails. Just endless walls of emails.

You know you shouldn’t respond to scammers but remote work made it a sort of guilty pleasure.

From “your future self”…? 
That’s a new one.
P2:
Hello. I am your future self.
P: 
Tell me the angle.
How will you, playing me, from the future con me?
P2:
(picture of themselves)
Happy birthday!

It has to be a decent shimmer…
Maybe they swiped your face online…?
P2:
No scam, no shimmer, just a fair warning.
P2:
The infuser has a flaw and will malfunction.
It's on page 40 of the design document.
P2:
You'll identify the issue, but you won't rectify it.
P:  
Why don’t I rectify it?
 

P2:
That’s for you to find out. If I just tell you now, you won’t learn!
Be nice to dad, ok? He’ll learn, too. 
Remember to pack your headphones before you leave.


You get the last word with your “future self”.
P2: 
Talk to you again next tick!
P:
You are blocked and reported.

You freeze an unexpected surge of frustration and gently close the messenger.
You try your hardest to put the interaction out of your active memory. 
It’s just a scammer… It has to be.
Besides, you’ve received way worse than that. At least your “future self” wasn’t threatening to kill you. 


You don’t recall anything noteworthy* or dangerous about page 40… 
*Though it is where the uncaught flaws would hide, now that you think about it…

Maybe you’ll check the infuser design doc again…
Really quick.



Your cell rings.
You look at the caller ID.
It’s your father.


You take one last look at the page before you answer.

His voice is bright and almost deafening. You can practically hear the smile he’s forcing.
You put on your coat. 
P:
Hey dad.


He’s been trying to reach you all morning. 
You step outside.
A package is on its way to your old job, or as he insists on calling it, “the witchery.”
P:
I’ve actually been working from home.
I can reroute it.


There’s a brief pause on the other end, as if he's struggling to picture you anywhere else. You can almost see the image he’s failing to conjure.

He returns to the matter at hand, asking you to confirm the package's arrival without “making a big fuss about it.”
You’re not sure what he’s trying to imply here.
P:
…
Right.



You again remember what day it is - or more accurately what this day is to your father.
P:
I’ve told you that I don’t need the birthright…
I - I don’t know where I’d even put them!


His laughter rings hollow over the phone.
He launches into a familiar speech about the import of birthrights.
Frustration burns behind your eyes. 


P:
I don’t want to partake in that aspect of the tradition.
I don’t think I-
Your father stops you right there.
He basically repeats his birthright speech, with a heavier sprinkling of guilt.
P:
Right.

Your father pauses.
Am I right, or am I understood?
P:
Underthood*.
*understood


Your father inappropriately asks how your tusks are growing. 

P:
I need to get back to work.

There's an awkward warmth in his voice as he expresses love and bids you farewell.

P:
I love you too, dad.
P:
Remember to get me the tracking number for it, I can reroute it.


He says he’ll do that, and seems to just manage to suppress another speech.

P:
Ok.
Bye.


You let out an exasperated sigh.
Your father has a talent for idiotic lectures. 
Guilt immediately follows your exasperation.
He means well, you remind yourself.
Really, it's not his fault he doesn't understand.


You linger outside for a few ticks listening to the city rain.
Today’s been strange, but there’s something else.
It started right when you saw that mug from last night you left on your desk.
There’s an…
Off feeling. 
You‘re not certain it’s just your imagination. 


Your father sends you the service and tracking number.
Oh gods, he’s sending it by person…?

You hurriedly send a shipping modification request from your father’s email.
You try and fail to not notice the contents of his inbox.
He’s entirely web-illiterate.
He’ll sign up for anything and everything hunting related. You had to manually unsubscribe him from at least a dozen mailing lists before you gave up helping him. 
You wonder if you can find a buyer for the tusks before they arrive - you could just reroute it straight to them.
You might get enough for them to buy that overhead organizer…


You close the window to find your doc still open to page 40.


It shouldn’t be possible for a mistake to have slipped through.
Months of clear peer reviews, audits, and rebalances had been enough to convince you of that.
So why are you doubting it now?
Because your “future self” told you?


You wonder how the “future self” scam works…
What would that have accomplished?
Whoever it was knew about the infuser and your involvement to some extent. The design doc and page number could have been informed guesses.
But to what end? 
To threaten you?
To distract you? 


You have trouble ignoring the thought that if there were a flaw, like your “future self” says, it means you, and potentially you alone, would hold the responsibility to find and correct it.

***

There’s a few last things you have to take care of.


You leave your birds the rest of the seeds you found.
They are awestruck.


You watch them hop and chirp around the pile of seeds.
In raising them from abandoned chicks, you unintentionally domesticated them.
At their age they should have their own nest.
You hope they’ll be alright…

You play them a farewell tune on your beloved flute. 


You’ll be back.
Now, you have to go.


You take a look back at your treehouse.


You jump.


You catch a vine.


You only make it one swing towards the river before you hear weeping.


That’s gotta be the willow.
You wonder what’s wrong now…?
You adjust course, sliding down a moss covered branch.


M:
Hey the willow what’s up?
Is something wrong?
  

The willow laments your impending absence.

M:
I know :(
but
I’ll be back!
I mean- you are the one who said that i’d die here at home!
so i HAVE to come back at some point!


The willow bursts back into a full cry. 

M:
Hey it’ll be ok! <333 :)


The willow explains between sobs that you’ll be different on your return.

M:
Well we all change, right?


M:
Oh!
Right
I got you something.


You rummage through your bindle, pulling out your beloved flute.


You snap it in half. 


M:
you'll have a piece of me with you while I'm gone! :)
When I come back, no matter how different I might be, we’ll put this back together and i’ll play you a song.

You place one half of Your broken beloved flute in the nook of a branch of the willow.


The willow sniffs a thank you.
It has to warn you.
You won’t bring back your mother.


M:
I know…
I just.
I don’t think it’s true.
I think there’s a way.
Remember that one time you said I was going to get attacked by jaguars and it turned out they were just playing?
So sometimes it’s not for sure!
Not that you’re not wise! You’re like the wisest tree i know!

The willow sighs.


You both don’t say anything for a while.
You try to memorize everything around you right now.
The breeze, the sound of the river, the bugs, the birds…

Everything’s right, but somehow it feels like there’s something mean and selfish deep underneath all of existence. It sends a shiver down your spine. 


M:
Hey, the willow?
I need to get going, ok?


You are bid farewell by the wind through the willow’s branches.

M:
I’ll be back! :)
 

You’re swinging back on course to the river.

You dive into the river.

Your hair gets in your face when you surface.
 
You

The boss tells you to get off your phone for once and to enjoy the show.

The boss’s been in there too long.

You inspect the new team.





Every interaction is a chance to win. 
You ordered faster than the guy in front of you, stealing minutes of his lifespan in the process. Win.





The regional director’s proposal is garbage.
He knows it. 
But that doesn’t matter. What matters is winning. 


You lean back, letting him sweat.

You take a casual look at your cell.
Your stocks are in a precarious rise. 


"Let's take a break," you tell him.
His eyes widen just a fraction. That's fear.


The true art is making them destroy themselves while they believe you're their savior. Like Thompson last week - all it took was a few "friendly" suggestions about betting his mortgage on a "sure thing." Now he's ruined, and you... well, you get to feed on failure. That's the secret they don't tell you about Lady Luck's bargain - other people's losses fuel your wins.

You’ve gotten so much better that you've started winning at games you didn't even know you were playing. Cards dealing themselves while you sleep. Dice rolling in your pockets. It’s a little creepy, if you’re being honest.
But that's fine. That's all fine. Because you're winning. You're finally WINNING.

Strat of	 Passion
strat of Passion

You are in the highest realm.
(management and admin, utopic urban)

A: strat of Passion
“To stay in touch with feelings, they interiorize everything, taking everything personally, but become self-absorbed and introverted, moody and hypersensitive, shy and self-conscious, unable to be spontaneous or to “get out of themselves.” Stay withdrawn to protect their self-image and to buy time to sort out feelings.”

You are A.


You guess MAYBE it’s time for you to get out of bed.
The sun’s starting to set and your bedside glass is empty again.
You’re feeling like a Poet tonight.

The dream you’ve been journaling turned out disappointingly expected  after you wrote it down.
Like- teeth? Really? Can you *get* more basic?

You stretch and end up sort of dance walking through the last rays of the sunset with a grace that surprises you.
Maybe you’re in the zone!

You try doing the bridge of I’m Me off of the Odd One Out musical.
Ok. maybe not that zone
For no reason a ton of random shit flies off the shelf behind you.

You glance back at the scattered debris, and shake your head.
You laugh, the sound echoing oddly in the quiet house.
The idea of your laugh’s echo being dampened by invisible bodies of an expectant audience surfaces unbidden.   

Poet

{Chaos, discord, and disaster are rendered profoundly hilarious.}




You never liked that statue anyway.
You went too big too fast and lost its form.
What’s for breakfast?

Biggest Critic
{All artistic efforts are met with self-doubt, criticism, or a sense of inadequacy.}

You text your agent some material.
You’ve been doing these awful jokey poems since you got moved in. 
A:
Tips for surviving exile, part one billion:
dance often
keep the place clean

You hate each and every one of them except for the first one.
The first one was perfect.
Every poem since has been nothing but shrinking echoes of the first.
You performed it early morning the day after you arrived on a royal cocktail of deliciously potent vintage you swiped from the family wine catacombs and a variety of amphetamines you swiped from the family pharmacy, all smoked thoroughly in a parade of increasingly sloppily hand rolled cigarettes.
You were in the zone.

Unfortunately the royal cocktail that granted you such *genius* also robbed you of any memory of the act. You just woke up with your best work scrawled on the wall in blood and what might have been green bloodcake sauce.
You haven’t let CLARA touch it since, despite her protests.
Biggest Critic

A:
Hello butterfly window!

A:
Good evening stair gargoyles!

A:
Hello kitchen…
You’re… looking messy…
CLARA~♫?
Are you back?

The silence in the house sits and waits with you.
It’s been like, maybe two or three days since she went into town.


You decide to focus on breakfast. 
You open the fridge, finding it mostly empty except for some questionable leftovers and a carton of eggs.


You crack the first egg into a bowl, shell fragments rain down with the yolk. You fish them out with your fingers, muttering curses. 

The second egg slips from your hand, splattering on the floor.


You manage to salvage enough egg for a small portion and turn on the stove.

You pour the eggs into the pan, where they immediately start to stick and burn. 
The smell of charred egg fills the kitchen.


You scrape the blackened mess onto a plate.
Well, that’s breakfast sorted. Burnt eggs à la exile.

Starving Artist

You’ll have breakfast on the beach this evening.
You need to get out of this empty house.
You grab a coconut rum and the last of the espresso shots you had CLARA pre-make from the fridge to match the occasion.


You step out the front door.
A:
Be back soon~♫!


Your art sits in the driveway like… alien gravestones…? -Like a better simile.


You really wish the staff put this stuff inside *before* they quit.
You and CLARA don’t have the equipment to move it.
You got the impression they left it like this on purpose, to spite you. 


You walk through the sandy parting in the trees down to the beach.

You set down your breakfast and drinks and walk directly into the ocean.
You’ve been doing this a lot lately. 

You wade into the ocean. 
You get a call.


You try to keep it smooth.
A:
Hey!
CLARA!
…
H-how’s it going?

“How’s it going”? You never say that!

CLARA says hi in an unusual way.
You are the problem again. 
A:
I- uh.
Are you mad at me?
  
She’s not mad. Just tired.
A:
Yeah me too actually- I just woke up but you know how I can still be sleepy in the morning- even though it’s night now…

She asks where you are. 
A:
Ocean.

She asks you to be careful.
The wind picks up.
A:
I-I know, I am, you always tell me.
You tear up for some reason.
You feel a shift in the ocean current.

She says there’s a storm coming.

You start to ask CLARA something, but the moment before you can get it out, a massive wave crashes over your head. 

The salt stings your eyes as you rise to the surface, coughing and sputtering. 
Your phone is gone.
You curse.

You should go back, find another way to call CLARA back- if that’s even possible…
You should, but you don’t do anything.
You’re tired.
You lay back, letting the ocean carry you.

As you drift, thoughts race through your mind.
You think of your art, your poems, your struggles.
You think of CLARA, her voice, her concern.
And then, you think of so many things that you think nothing at all. You simply exist, a part of the ocean, the incoming storm, the universe.
This is where you belong, one with the chaos, the beauty, the raw power of nature.
Let the storm come.

You get out of bed to investigate.


Dream Leeched
(X) : Yo(u)seless
* Impairs decision making in the most important task of the day. *

You’re a little staggered, but you’ll admit it’s not the first time getting out of bed was the most important task of your day. At least you got it out of the way.
You think about leaving it alone, but you decide since you’ve already kind of committed, you might as well check it out.


You close your eyes around your dresser’s mirror so you’ll be able to get back to sleep.
There could be something magic in the glowing box.
It kind of looks like a magic glow, but it could just be blurred afterimages. 

You open the glowing box.

It’s a cell.
It’s your roommate’s cell.
Likely place. This is their stuff.
The screen is ablaze with notifications - missed calls and messages, all recent, numbering in the low hundreds.

“See you soon”?

You jump a little at the sudden vibration and sickly sweet jingle.
Someone’s calling. 

You answer.

H:
hello?

They’re talking quickly, you don’t know what to say.
H:
uh
im their roommate

They sound embarrassed somehow.
You sit at your desk.

You absentmindedly tab over from your school email to your private email as you listen to the caller apologize. 

You open a new email from yourself.
You say to the caller: 

H:
no it’s fine
actually he’s the one who woke me up 

Your future self says to you: 
H:

And the caller asks you something but you don’t hear them.

It’s not raining anymore…
Maybe you should get out of here.
You’re not going to get back to sleep, anyway.

Your saucer’s autopilot announces another successful landing.
1: 
Finally.
2: 
Another day in hell.
3: 
This is the worst part of your job. 


You check your reflection.
1: 
Absolutely predatory.
Cold blooded.
Like a space-shark. 
2: 
One day older.
3:
You look great!


You disembark.
1:
These soon-to-be-homeless fools should count themselves lucky you're dropping their studio during the planet's pseudo-summer, before the binary stars separate.
2:
Overdressed.
Again.
3:
What a pleasant climate!
Are those real flowers?


Your agent waits for you by the gate.
He holds up a neatly stacked folder as you approach.
1:
Your loyal familiar.
2:
Ever since he botched the Mole merch deal you can’t ignore that annoyingly apologetic rat grin. 
3:
He printed copies of your notes!
He always goes the extra space-mile!

Clue:
Let’s make this quick. 


Your agent laughs as he opens the door for you.
1:
He likes the bloodshed too.
2:
You weren’t joking.
3:
You do love his joviality!
You’re glad he’s here; it’s always easier to deal with unpleasantness when he’s around!


The moment you step into the reception area, you're greeted by what looks to be the whole team and a gift basket.
1:
Desperation radiates off them in waves.
It’s actually intoxicating.
2:
Somewhere on this planet, a marketing strategist is sweating bullets, praying that this gambit pays off.
3:
This is too kind!
Who told them you liked old empire proofs?


Your agent steps forward to shake hands with the studio head.
She’s so excited to show you both what she and the team have been working on.
1:
She looks like she’ll have far to fall.
You were starting to worry there wouldn’t be something you could sink your teeth into.
2:
You’re getting a clearer picture now.
The man has the self control of a space-hound.
3:
Her enthusiasm is contagious!

Clue:
Thank you for the kind reception.


She gestures to a hallway on the far end of the lobby.
She says you’ll love this.
You and your agent exchange a glance.
1:
You smell blood. 
2:
Your agent is looking genuinely excited.
You make a mental note to debrief him later—he’s been too sympathetic to these doomed cases lately.
3:
Another surprise? 


The hallway is lined with holographic posters of past projects.
The studio head and your agent engage in small talk.
1:
There’s a deliciously tragic charm in the earnestness of their marketing.
2:
Echoes of mediocrity.
3:
Such a rich creative history!
How did you not know they made Voyager?  


You and your agent are ushered into a small empty theater.
After handing out show directories, the studio head bows at the entrance and tells you to enjoy.

1:
Oh you will.
2:
Another hollow spectacle.
Why are you even entertaining this?
3:
What an elegant setup!


You skim the directory.
Your agent sends you a nervous glance.
1:
A deliciously pitiful mess.
You can’t wait. 
2:
You make him nervous.
3:
It’s charming how much he cares!

Clue:
We told you no more pitch performances.
We told you that word gets out.
We told you that just sitting here will soft launch this faulty premise further than it deserves.  


He asks you to just let them get through their presentation.
He has a good feeling about this one.
1:
You want to tear into this as much as he does, but this command is out of line.
Correct him.
2:
Risk assessment should never be influenced by feelings.
He’s never understood that.
3:
You love his optimism!

Clue:
Is it the twist that gives you a good feeling?
The one that’s still early and underdeveloped?
The twist we told them to work on specifically under threat of dropping the studio?


Your agent understands why it might not look like it, but they’ve really worked hard on this presentation.
If not for them, do it for him, he says.
1:
Why isn’t he backing down?
2:
That’s not his usual manipulation tactic.
You are caught off guard.
3:
You should hear him out!

Clue:
There’s 8 acts.
We’re calling it at 3.    


The lights dim.
Your agent objects.
You point at the stage.
Clue:
It’s starting.

Augur 	of	 Joys 
Augur of Joy 

***


You knock on your parents doors louder this time.

***

The foot butler whispers to you that your parents are probably just sleeping in with its twirly voice.

L:
But it's the bestest day!
They never sleep in on the bestest day!
You play the doors like an instrument to emphasize your point.

*** 

The foot butler keeps doing its worried whispers, trying to tempt you toward the sunshine outside.
Through the big window, you can see the festival flags waving like colorful butterflies.
Even if it wasn’t the bestest day, you'd rush right out to play, but something feels different today. Something important.

L:
Stop asking!
I told you!
***
You are bid a good morning and a happy holy day in the silvery voice of the head butler. Its neck stretches down gracefully, like one of the garden beasts.
The head butler asks what is going on.
You explain.
L:
You gotta help me wake them up!
We need to make my knocks louder!

***

That's when you notice the head butler isn't looking at you anymore. Its shiny eye-things are studying something on the floor - a pretty red puddle that's creeping out from under Mommy and Daddy's door, like paint or berry juice or-
The head butler's neck dips down for a tiny taste.

L:
Me too!
You reach for the mysterious red, but the head butler's branch hands lift you up like a feather.
The head butler hums thoughtfully, making fancy grown-up sounds like "bouquet" and "notes of spring". You don't understand why the head butler's talking about wine when there's clearly a magical red puddle to play with.

L:
Can I just try it?
Just a little!
The head butler makes a face.
L:
please?
The head butler makes a sound like wind through crystal and finally nods. One small touch, young royal. Mind your sleeves, it says.

The red is invisibly lukewarm on your fingertip, and when you taste it... it's like something from a dream you can't quite remember. Sweet, but also... like copper pennies and that time you bit your lip too hard.

The head butler says in its teaching voice that this is blood - fresh, and of quite fine quality - your parents must have received a fresh delivery from the northern bloodyard.
Your heart does a scary flip-flop before the head butler's words make sense. Not Mommy and Daddy's blood! Just their special grown-up drink from the blood farmers up north. You giggle at how silly you were.

L:
Could we use it?
Like a key or something?

The head butler is afraid not. Some mysteries must solve themselves in their own time.
The head butler says they'll wake when they wake, so perhaps we should prepare a special Celebration Day breakfast while we wait.
The thought brightens you up. 
Maybe the smell of honey cakes will work better than knocking! 

You take The head butler's offered branch, skipping toward the kitchen, but you can't help glancing back at the door one last time.

The red puddle seems to wave goodbye with tiny ripples, and you try and fail to remember something.

***

The kitchen is different today.
You've never seen it so... still. Usually it's full of busy servants and floating dishes and the happy chaos of breakfast. But now it's just you and the head butler, and all the pots and pans are hanging too quietly on their hooks.
Even the breakfast bells are sleeping.
L:
Where is everyone?
The head butler's branches rustle thoughtfully as it reaches for ingredients. Celebrating, young royal, it says.
That doesn't sound right. The festival always starts with the Royal Family's blessing. Everyone knows that. You say so, proud of remembering such an important fact.
The head butler's crystal voice cracks, just a little. "Indeed."
L: We should go get them! The people need us!
"Patience," the head butler says again, but its neck is curved away from you now, studying the window. Outside, the festival flags seem less like butterflies and more like warning signs, their shadows making strange shapes on the kitchen floor.

The dishes aren't dancing their usual morning waltz. The spoons aren't gossiping about yesterday's meals. Even the oven's usual warm grumble sounds more like a worried whisper.
Butler demonstrates how to measure the golden honey, but you're distracted by voices drifting in through the window. The festival crowds sound different too - all hushed and hurried, like secrets trying to run away.

It’s been 7 weeks, if your math is right.
49 days and 147 “meals” ago you were free.
Well- as free as you could have been. Time in this cell has granted you dark enlightenment — that the truth is that you’ve been in a prison your whole life. A metaphorical prison.

The SCORES in your VENGEANCE TRACKER update.

You look out the barred window.
The daily delivery airship is almost visible in the distance.
Right on time.
In response to your dominance over time itself, the VENGEANCE TRACKER SCORE “Time’s Insolence” is settled. 

***


You remove the poster that covers the work in progress hole in your wall.

***


You do some preparatory stretches as you wait for the airship to pass overhead. 

***


The moment approaches. Your muscles twitch in anticipation.
He thought he could break you. He thought you’d just give up. Just shrivel up and die in exile. Like mom.
Little does dear old dad know, your imprisonment has reforged you. 

***


As the airship's roar reaches its peak, you release your daily barrage of punches.
A fresh fissure appears in the bricks, like a fist unfurling outward from the point of impact.  

***

Your fist breaks through, fueled by pure DOMINANCE multiplied ten thousand times over by your Enlightened Fury.
The wall weeps dust, inaugural tears of your impending freedom. 
You pry open a brick maw of freedom, exploding through the last vestiges of the wall. 

***


The dust settles, revealing a startled inmate. And another cell.

***


You curse.
This was not supposed to happen. You were sure that your cell wall was shared with a hallway, not another goddamned cell…
The inmate asks who the hell you are, which is a stupid question, since your name, like his, is printed on your jumpsuit.
You briefly consider whether this level of obliviousness is a survival trait here or the reason he's imprisoned.

The SCORE "Misleading Cell Architecture" is added to the VENGEANCE TRACKER.

***


You send the inmate’s bed pinwheeling across the cell and size up the wall.
You figure with how much you’ve grown strength-wise that you’ll be able to break through this one in less than the 49 days it took for the last one. But still, it’s an unwelcome setback.

BUFFED: 
Delayed Wrath
[When setback, interrupted, or delayed, next use of DOMINANCE will triple in intensity.]

***


You notice something about his poster.
S:
What…
 

***

The inmate kind of cries something before you rip it off the wall to reveal a hole.

Due to your Delayed Wrath BUFF, you end up taking a triply DOMINANCE fueled step towards the inmate. The floor beneath your foot cracks.
He’s cowering before your next step has the chance to land.
You grab the inmate by the collar.
S:
Did you do this?

He whimpers that yes, he did this.
S:
How?
He points at a pile of metal meal plates. His collection from way back- before they went paper, he stammers. 
And he found those, pointing to a pickaxe and shovel.

S: How long have you been digging?
Inmate: M-months. Almost a year, I think. Please don't hurt me!

You release his collar, your mind racing with the implications. A year of work, and he's probably close to freedom. Your Delayed Wrath subsides, replaced by a cold calculation that would make your father proud – and horrified.
S: Show me how far you've gone.





S:
Are you the one who’s been delivering my meals…?

From behind the poster, you hear the guard and demand you to make yourself seen.

S:
Screw it, if you’re a guard you’ve had to have delivered at least one, right?

You watch the guard’s lamp light center through the poster.

S:
That works for me.

You launch yourself off of the back of the tunnel wall fueled by

Mirroring
[In any social interaction there is a 50% chance of temporarily adopting one trait or opinion of the other party, increasing chances to CHARM.]


Your head snaps up at the sound of your name over the intercom.

***

You run to the sink to wash your hands.

***


You have to try multiple times to get the mirror to approve of your work.
You hear your second warning.

***


You run out of the bathroom and into the aisles.
 Your first warning was maybe 3 milliticks ago, meaning you have maybe 2 milliticks to get back to your station…

***


You round a corner to find your older coworker ALFRED sitting in front of a shelf.
He greets you warmly, like he always does, and asks if you can help him up.

***


You help him up.
You are thanked for your efforts with an anecdote about getting older and being unable to get up after sitting down, before you cut it short.
9:
Sorry ALFRED, I gotta go, they're calling me on the intercom!
***

As you run you hear thousands of nearly inaudible clicks far above you.
Your eyes dart upward, widening in horror and realization as you see the telltale signs of impending "rainfall." Tiny nozzles, hidden among the rafters and light fixtures, begin to twitch and rotate. 
Of course it would happen now, when you're already late and exposed in the open aisles. You increase your pace, your legs burning with the effort.
***

You hear your final warning as you round the last corner to your station.
The air fills with the sharp chemical smell of bleach.
The first drops begin to fall. Tiny, stinging pinpricks on your exposed skin, because of course you left your poncho.
You push yourself harder, lungs burning, muscles screaming.
***

You dive the last few feet, sliding across the freshly polished floor and under the protective awning of your workstation. The rain intensifies, a hissing torrent that turns the world outside into a blurry, burning haze.
***

Safe. But late.
As the downpour reaches its peak, transforming the aisles into sterile rivers of foam, your supervisor materializes beside you.
***

Your supervisor informs you of your third and final tardy strike. You can feel their gaze boring into you, analytical and cold. They're waiting for something – a protest maybe, an excuse, a plea for mercy. But you offer nothing. What could you say? The rules are the rules, and you broke them. Three strikes.
Still, you don't regret helping Alfred. His warm smile flashes in your memory, weathered and genuine – one of the few real things left in this place. You wonder if he made it to shelter before the rain. He usually keeps his poncho close, unlike you.
"Your shift ends at closing," your supervisor finally says, their voice modulated to perfect neutrality. "Report directly to Repurposing. Do not visit your locker. Do not clock out. Do not speak to other associates."
The words send a chill down your spine, colder than any bleach rain. You've heard rumors about Repurposing – whispers exchanged in break rooms and loading docks. They say the most helpful employees are chosen first. They say it's an honor.
"Now, please resume your duties. The Store needs you." Their emphasis on that last word carries weight, heavy with promise and threat. 
As they glide away, melting into the maze of aisles, you turn to your terminal.
Your fingers hover over the keyboard as the fans gradually wind down, leaving behind the Store's usual symphony of gentle muzak and distant beeping. Somewhere in the building, Alfred is probably still smiling, still offering his warm greetings to everyone who passes. You wonder if he knows. You wonder if he chose this too, once upon a time, with that same helpful instinct that just sealed your fate.

You get off the monorail.

Mom texts you again about the loyalty points you’ll receive on her death.

You can’t help but text S while you sit in the repurposing waiting room.
You hope they don’t bill you for your phone usage… You are technically off the clock, but you’ve been dinged before.

  

Beast 	of	 Order 		2
You are P.

***

You step off the gondola.
Something starts feeling wrong again.
Nothing looks off about the station… Maybe a little ice recession, but it’s within expected threshold.

You perform an internal gratitude prayer for everything going to plan.

You wave to the guard.
This one doesn’t like you.
You’re only ever polite to her.
P: 
Hello again.
Checking on a component.

The guard asks for your ID.

P: 
You didn’t get an open door order from the company?

The guard asks for your ID again.
You hand it over.
The guard asks who you’re with.

P: 
…Thell*.
*Cell

The guard smirks.
…Was that on purpose? Did she know?
She’s psychotic!
You pick your words carefully for a reason.

 

P: 
How do you know it will malfunction? 
P2:
The component explodes.
Not even a hello?
P: 
When will it do that?
P2:
Right after you put on your noise canceling headphones.
Good thing you brought them, right?

You look up at the electric box.
Good thing you brought them… 

Gets arrested, dropped off at apartment hours later, tusks arrived.

You reach the near shore.

You’ve been here once before to watch that big thing float by when you were little.

You notice an odd amount of bubbles surfacing in the water.

The water snake greets you.
It calls you a “biped”. You are not sure what that means.

M:
Hello!
You know how to get across here?

The water snake doesn’t say anything. 

(snake accepts to take M across to watch his suffering)



Strat of	 Passion  2

***


You wake up.
You ended up on the beach chair. 


Is that sunrise?
How long were you out…?

Looks like the seagulls finished your breakfast for you.
You don’t mind.

You breathe a sigh of relief finding a decent 6 or 7 sips remaining of your coconut rum espresso concoction.



You light a cigarette and lay back.
You listen to the rain on the umbrella above.


You dreamt something weird for once.
There were… strings, or something. Like hanging or coming from your hands…
Too bad you don’t have your dream journal…


You feel a deep grossness.
The wind picks up and wakes you up fully with a cold mist.
Maybe you should get inside.


You spill the remainder of your drink when you stand up because of fucking course you can’t do anything right.

You just leave everything there and trudge back up the sandy path, the wind whipping around you.
Something sounds different - a distant clatter, like bones or metal, echoing from the driveway.

The art sits scattered now. Fallen sculptures. Canvases at awkward angles.
As you start gathering them, you notice how many paintings are CLARA-centric. Her silhouette. Her back turned. Her hands. Always her, always just out of reach.


-walk back up hill, see art pieces blown over (add earlier sound)
-run up hill, slip and fall
-notices the CLARA-centric paintings while packing them
-plays maid card
-CLARA returns, tries to help, ends up arguing with A while they move the art
-A feels abandoned, why is CLARA apologizing, though?
-CLARA tells A they are leaving

Fiend 	of	 Insight	  2

You end up at the university library.

You peek through the open door.
Looks like they still have the tape up around the floorboards convexed by the overgrowth of the library sponge. You don’t think that’ll ever get fixed.
Your roommate figured the sponge got too valuable to the admin once it soaked up the senior thesis archives. He said it would probably be more cost effective for them to build a new library using the returns of a matured sponge. 
You’ll have to go around.

You take the the forest walkway that rounds the university library.

You fail to ignore the path that forks off of the walkway.
It’s in complete shadow, the buzzing yellowed lights of the true route fail to penetrate the ragged hole in the wall of trees.
This would be the path he took, if the police reports are to be believed.

The thought that you might be following in his footsteps should chill you, but it’s the flare of something that feels like morbid curiosity that makes you turn away.
 
You arrive at the university library’s side entrance - a fire-escape cast iron staircase bolted to the side of the building.
Disintegrating unlaminated printouts notating the entrance flap audible and wet in the wind.

The side entrance opens onto the children’s literature and folklore wing.
It’s blissfully empty of the fairy tale majors that used to snag your roommate with endless small talk.

You abseltmindedly trail your fingers over the spines of the books.

It looks like one fell off the shelf…

In a leaf's dark fold, two caterpillars curled,
Closest of friends in their tiny world.
One night, strange changes began to unfold,
A silent transformation, cryptic and cold.

The first grew still, wrapped tight in its shroud,
While the other watched, trembling and cowed.
Days passed in silence, no movement, no sound,
Until gossamer wings burst forth, unbound.

A butterfly returned, with eyes of strange gleam,
"I've been chosen," it whispered, "by a council supreme.
Up in the sky, where the wind softly sings,
They've called me to join their mysterious wings."

The caterpillar shuddered, sensing something askew,
As the butterfly smiled—was it promise or rue?
"Come with me soon," it murmured low,
"The council awaits. Soon, you'll know."
